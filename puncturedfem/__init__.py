PuncturedFEM
============

A Python package for the numerical solution of PDEs on meshes with punctured
and curvilinear elements.

The method can be roughly described as a "non-virtual" virtual element method,
as the same function space is used, but the basis functions are used directly
as degrees of freedom. The method also borrows ideas from boundary element
methods, specifically when it comes to performing computations (e.g. H^1
semi-inner products) with the implicitly-defined basis functions.

See README.md for the latest references and more information.
