An approximate solution to $-\Delta u + u = 1$ on a rectangle with a zero Dirichlet boundary condition.
The mesh consists of 11 cells, 5 of which are multiply connected, and all have curvilinear boundaries.
See [examples/ex2-pacman-fem.ipynb](https://github.com/samreynoldsmath/PuncturedFEM/tree/main/examples/ex2-pacman-fem.ipynb).

## Description
A finite element method on meshes with curvilinear and multiply connected cells.

One might call the method a "nonvirtual virtual element method" because it uses the same function spaces as the virtual element method [1], but works with basis functions directly, rather than projecting them and introducing stabilization terms.

One advantage of our approach is the ability to find values of the basis functions (and therefore the finite element solution) in the interior of mesh cells, not just on the mesh skeleton.
However, all essential calculations (such as entries of the stiffness and mass matrices) are occur entirely on cell boundaries, using single-dimensional quadrature.

A disadvantage of our approach is that it is currently limited to planar domains. This is because we are able to exploit some results from complex analysis to compute the basis functions and their derivatives.

Given a mesh cell $K \in \mathcal{T}$, the **local Poisson space** $V_p(K)$ consists of $v \in H^1(K)$ such that:

- the Laplacian $\Delta v$ is a polynomial of degree at most $p-2$ on $K$,
- the trace $v|_{\partial K}$ on the boundary of the mesh cell is continuous, and
- the restriction $v|_{e}$ to each edge $e$ of the mesh cell is the trace a polynomial of degree at most $p$.

One may see that $V_p(K)$ contains the space of polynomials of degree at most $p$ on $K$, but is typically a much richer space.
The **global Poisson space** $V_p(\mathcal{T})$ is the space of continuous functions $v \in H^1(\Omega)$ such that $v|_K \in V_p(K)$ for all $K \in \mathcal{T}$, where $\mathcal{T}$ is a mesh of the domain $\Omega$.

A discussion of the method, including interpolation estimates, is given in [3].
A method of computing $L^2$ inner products and $H^1$ semi-inner products of functions in $V_p(K)$, with $K$ simply connected, is given in [2,4].
The multiply connected case is discussed in [5].
