# Mathematical Background

## Prerequisites
We will assume that the reader is familiar with:

- Partial differential equations (PDEs)
- Finite element methods (FEM)
- Complex analysis, especially the Cauchy-Riemann equations

## Motivation

## Poisson Spaces

## A Dirichlet-to-Neumann Map for Harmonic Functions

## An Anti-Laplacian of a Harmonic Function

## Multiply Connected Mesh Cells

## Modified Poisson Spaces (in progress)
This work has yet to be published.
